_Free your hotbar._

Utility Belt is a mod for the Fabric & Quilt mod loaders that allows you to clean up valuable hotbar space. It is
similar to the Tool Belt mod for Forge.

to be used.

## Modpack Creators

If you are a modpack creator wishing to modify the list of tools that can be inserted into the utility belt, you may use
the `allow_in_utility_belt` item tag. Hopefully this will be a rare case, as compatibility with other mods should be
automatic ([report it](https://github.com/JamCoreModding/utility-belt/issues/new) if you think something's missing!).
