- [#30] Reset the clientside belt state when disconnecting from a world (see below)
  - Player plays on world A, with a utility belt. They leave while swapped to the belt
  - They join world B, without a utility belt. They will still be swapped to the belt even though they don't have one. Hotbar unusable.
- Fix a fairly inconsequential (non-crashing) NPE with mythic metals.
